# PEP_Chromatogram_Visualization
A PEP toolbox for simpler visualization of raw chromatogram data. Chromeleon raw data files in the .txt format are to large for simple excel analysis, therefore, this python script will allow the user to visulaize their data with out needing the knowlegde of coding. 


## Project description 

Chromatogram files in the .txt format contain intensity values on the y-axis and retention time on the x-axis. Visualization of chromatogram data requires the plotting of both x and y values for several different files and plotting them either overlain or sperate and is not possible with excel alone. Visulaization of chromatogram using the Seaborn package will allow the user to determine all necessay parameters for their individual needs.
